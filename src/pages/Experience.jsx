            <p>With great motivation, I finally founded my own technology company with some friends called NULL REBORN in 2016. Running a company with limited resources and funds make the whole team especially me to concurrently and focus on multiple responsibilities in order to maintain company stability. I am CEO and also Product Owner, IT Consultant, and Frontend engineer, I have to do a job with a high level of stress, sometimes I have bad experience with time management when several task running at the same time. But the good thing I got is I became a person who dared to make decisions and solve the problems in a fairly limited time.</p>
